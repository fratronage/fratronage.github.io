  <h1>About Fratronage Services</h1>
  <p>
    Fratronage is an concept/experiment service aimed at taking advantage of lost monetization opportunities in order to generate funds for enriching education and communities.
    The service is consequentially very new, and rough around the edges. In fact, it is a side pet project that is only worked on while a break is necessary from serious work.
    Therefore, please be patient and understanding as we unfortunately do not have the resources to keep any documentation of users and provide custom support.
    We actively monitor the effeciency of monetization, report finances, pay taxes, and budget funds for creating public good, and this already takes considerable effort!
    Due to same limitations, we also do not organize events or create reports for the content benefectors. It is up to the beneficiaries to show appreciation/report fund usage/brief impact to the benefectors.

  <p>This pro bono public service project is currently under the manage ment of Valuace LLC</p>
